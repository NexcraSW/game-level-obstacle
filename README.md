#### Overview ####
This code demonstrates a trap door hazard from a video game project I'm working on. It uses a finite state machine (FSM) with message passing capabilities to drive the hazards. The hazards themselves randomize their attributes to provide more interesting gameplay. The hazards can also be activated/deactivated as needed.
